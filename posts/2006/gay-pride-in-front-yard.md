![feather costume](/images/20060625-feathers.jpg) It's amazing what one can wake up to in the morning! After being shaken out of bed by loud motorcycle engines and continuous cheers, Amanda and I went outside to see what was up. It was the Gay Pride Parade! ![Gay Pride Parade in Denver, Colorado](/images/20060625-hereItIs.jpg) The parade route included my street here in Denver, Colorado. It was a quieter part of the parade, leaving room to receive lots of candy, necklaces, stickers, condoms, and lube. I was well stocked by the end of the parade. :) ![Elaborate Dress](/images/20060625-elaborateDress.jpg) Many of the floats were very entertaining. One featured beautiful dress and dance to the Macarena. Another that stuck out in my mind was a square dance trailer bed. ![parents support gay children](/images/20060625-parents.jpg) A group of parents walked by with signs supporting their gay family. Several walkers were in the parade including a long list of political candidates. ![sun tan](/images/20060625-sunTan.jpg) Everything goes at the Gay Pride Parade. Men tanning on trucks, sex dolls and balloons in the air, dogs in costumes just to name a few items. ![lovely gentlemen](/images/20060625-lovelyGuys.jpg) A couple lovely gentlemen posed for a picture. Their costumes were fantastic! ![stilt bike](/images/20060625-tallBike.jpg) My favorite part of the parade was the "stilt bikes". The parade was unexpected, and a lot of fun. As I sit here writing this now, I can feel the cavities take over as all this candy gets eaten.
