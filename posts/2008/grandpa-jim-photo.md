![Grandpa Jim and his horse](/images/grandpajim.jpg) I thought this was neat. Grandpa Jim sent over a photo of him with his horse. He moved his stallion closer to town, making it easier to take care of him,and ride him more often. Grandpa Jim is keeping busy in Montana. He's still kicking, helping an old friend with his cattle once in a while. It's pretty cold in Montana right now. He's pretty tough though and is living though it well.
