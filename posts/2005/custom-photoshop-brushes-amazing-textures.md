A student named Andrew inspired me to play with Photoshop brushes in class tonight. He used downloaded brushes to enhance the borders of a web mockup he presented. It turns out that there are many people at deviantart.com that submit custom brushes of all sorts for free use. ![abstract image 2](/images/20050801-abstract2.jpg) These brushes can be browsed through [here](http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psbrushes/). While some brushes require credit, links back, or sometimes payment to use for commercial purposes, most are given free in return for a thanks or a vote on the website. I used brushes from deviantart.com to produce the two images posted here. Both images were drawn fairly quickly. Possible applications of the resulting images are limitless. I'll be using custom brushes more often. They rock!
