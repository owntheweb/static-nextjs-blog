![powwow overview - lots of people](/images/20060325-powwow2.jpg) This was the second time I attended the Denver March Powwow. It was just as as exciting as last year! The annual powwow brings natives and visitors from regions as far as Canada and beyond. Social dances and competitions are held in the Denver Coliseum while crafts are on display behind the stands. ![close up of honor guard surrounded by dancers from different regions](/images/20060325-powwow1.jpg) forty-two drum/singing groups played in the grand opening one at a time while the arena filled with diverse colors. It was interesting to see the different styles from region to region. I enjoyed the different opening songs. Amanda helped me pick out some rock beads and various craft items before leaving. She's going to teach me how to make a dream catcher! I've always wanted to make one of those and can't wait to get started.
