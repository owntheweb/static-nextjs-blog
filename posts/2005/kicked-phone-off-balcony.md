Breaking news! I was making my Halloween costume outside on the 3rd floor balcony and accidentally kicked my phone off. It broke. Luckily, it was time to re-up my Verizon contract, so I got a camera phone for super cheap. I can't say that the phone has a super camera, but for a phone it works out quite well. ![Amanda and Chris](/images/20051112-amandaMe.jpg) Amanda helped me test out the camera. :) ![Sugar Cookies](/images/20051112-cookies.jpg) This morning we made sugar cookies for her work event. They taste great! Hopefully a few will make it to work.
