I worked with the worldâ€™s largest agricultural retailer in a hands-on tech lead role to help architect and build a new online store for farmers (Node.js, React, ELK).

This was an amazing eight month adventure! I joined Nutrien's green field startup project to serve farmers with online solutions. Before this project, farmers had to decide between mailing a $100,000 check for needed crop chemicals, or drive the check somewhere distant. After Nutrien's decision to expand online, I helped build an MVP shopping cart solution that made shopping easy.

Placeholder: There was so much professional growth that happened at Nutrien. At the time of writing while rebooting the personal blog, I'm placing here for memory and reminder to add additional details of the excellent people I met and tasks we worked on.
