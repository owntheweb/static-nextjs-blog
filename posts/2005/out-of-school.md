All done! With my BA in Interactive Media Design out of the way, some sleep is in order. I broke my record of staying awake. I was up for 26 hours, took a 1 hour nap, then attended graduation activities through a night party with my family. It was a good time. I was glad to see everybody that made it. ![Christopher Stevens and Dr. Kathy Lee](/images/20051002-graduate.jpg) Here is a picture Amanda took of me standing next to one of my professors, Dr. Kathy Lee, at the graduation review. The review showcased work of all who graduated. Visitors included family, students, and potential employers. I received the Award of Excellence for my work. Off to bed again!
