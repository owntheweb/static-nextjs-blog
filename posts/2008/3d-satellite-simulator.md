Developer

### Additional Credits

Data provided by [Space-Track](https://www.space-track.org/auth/login). Basic orbital mechanics courtesy of [AMSAT-UK](https://amsat-uk.org/) (note: original math links no longer active). Math converted into something usable in Flash with much help from various math experts. Special thanks to [Sandy 3D](https://code.google.com/p/sandy/) team for making a pixel class for showing 3D positions.

### Purpose

Simple questions, "How many satellites are orbiting Earth?" and, "How far up are they?" sparked a fun adventure and a major interest boost in space activities.

### Highlighted Features

Near-live simulation showcasing where 11,000+ unclassified pieces of stuff (satellites, space junk) are located around Earth.
