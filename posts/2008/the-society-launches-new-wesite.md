![The Society - New Website at http://thesociety.com](/images/homeseptemberlaunch.jpg) At last, a new [TheSociety.com](http://thesociety.com) is launched!! New stuff includes a new design and updated logo (yay for me), and a new "[Vacation MatchMaker](http://thesociety.com/matchmaker)" tool that lets The Society assist visitors in finding vacation homes. That's not all of course! Other features include [support for charity](http://thesociety.com/about/charity), enhanced [search](http://thesociety.com/search) capability, the ability to [browse properties by location](http://thesociety.com/destination), new and improved property and member profiles, the "[Reserve Collection](http://thesociety.com/benefits/criteria)", and more [member benefits](http://thesociety.com/benefits). This is a result of several months of hard work from a great team of developers. It's been great to have a chance to work in both php/mysql development and design/html/Flash in this latest release. Now it's time to get some extra sleep, then take over the world. :) See the full details of this website release [here](http://thesociety.com/blog/the-society-news/2008/09/the-society-launches-new-luxury-vacation-rental-website/).
