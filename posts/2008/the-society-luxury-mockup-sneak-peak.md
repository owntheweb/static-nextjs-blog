While I'm taking a small break from hammering out a luxurious design mockup for The Society of Leisure Enthusiasts, I thought I'd post a tease of one of the new design options. Have a peak! Before (The Society in the current live state): ![The Society of Leisure Enthusiasts current website look (may be old by time of reading)](/images/societypeakold.jpg) After (potential design option sneak peak): ![The Society of Leisure Enthusiasts potential new look sneak peak](/images/societypeaknew.jpg) That's all to see for now. Be sure to wipe the drool off your chin.
