While learning about the Arduino microprocessor and potential applications, I entered a tutorial contest with an "instructable" that teaches people how to play the Can Can with an Arduino and buzzer. It's off the wall for sure, but as a result it may win some additional hardware? :) [Check out the full tutorial here](http://www.budurl.com/buzzer).
