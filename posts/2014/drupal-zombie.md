The best way to absorb Drupal knowledge is to eat Drupal for breakfast...

With a DrupalCon Austin trip coming up and some basic 3D training on the agenda today, I wanted to refresh my geek wardrobe with something delicious.

I placed an order at Zazzle.com, also creating a little store to share the design with you. When viewed on a shirt, it offers the illusion that you're being fed delicious Drupal flavored gelatin cubes.

Mmmm. Blue flavor!
