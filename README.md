# A new blog!

It's time to reboot the personal blog. I want a statically generated blog to replace my personal and very outdated static website to keep the maintenance low and load speed super high. Let's explore what Next.js has to offer as it touts its static generation option and other helpers such as simple routing. Plus, Next.js is just a layer over React. I love React! Granted, the static option omits React features such as useEffect, useState, etc.,. Time to explore.

Also, going to explore partnering with AI to push things along. I don't have much time to make a blog (says most folks with jobs).

If you're reading this, don't pay too much attention. This is going to be UGLY for awhile. At the least I'll learn something and am happy to share. :D
