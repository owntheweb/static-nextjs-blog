Serving as development lead, a subscription website was built for *The Space Report Online: The Authoritative Guide to Global Space Activity*. It delivered over a decade of interactive analytical data, articles and charts covering the space industry. The website connects to Recurly APIs for payments and instant login access.

Clients now include several space agencies around the world, colleges, large aerospace corporations and a well known university.

Beyond architecture planning and management tasks, much of my time was spent building core features and offering training support for two excellent web developers and two equally great analysts/writers.
