### Status

Active

### Link

### Roles

Designer

### Purpose

Redesign a brand and website as part of a class project. I chose SETI@home as the search for extra terrestrial life with the help of home computer processing inspired me. While the web comp was a wash (website was already transitioning to Berkeley at the time), they did use the logo. Cool!
