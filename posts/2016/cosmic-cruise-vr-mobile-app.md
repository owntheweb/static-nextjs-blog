The Cosmic Cruise mobile app was designed as part of a Space Foundation booth draw/give-away at Space Symposium when Google Cardboard was fresh. The draw helped to start conversations about Space Foundation education programs. Cosmic Cruise allowed kids (and kids at heart) to explore our solar system in virtual reality on iPhone and Android devices. Special thanks goes to Bryan Jones (3D ship), Ron Sparkman (voice), Travis Schenck (voice), Brian McCarrie (artwork), Brigit Schroeder (analytics, smooth travel math, intro screen), Amy Mirocha (voice), Johnny Rumbach (music)!

Note: This app hasn't been updated for iOS 11+ and has audio issues as a result (archived project).
