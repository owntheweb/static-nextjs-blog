![Denver Webcam](/images/denver.jpg) The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment changed their webcam image June 5th just after 12pm. This is known because the beautiful live image seen at the top of this page (at time of writing anyway) quit importing properly after that time, leaving me stuck in time for a while. The new image is slightly larger than the image created previously, updates more often, and gets a better night view of Denver, Colorado. ![Denver Life Art Code Header](/images/denverlifeartcode.jpg) As it's almost time to change the design of this blog, an image of the dynamically created header can be seen above. Now, to find time to redesign this website.
