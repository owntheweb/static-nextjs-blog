For the music embedded in you...

The title, Embedded Signal, was inspired by wall tile art taken by Artem Garvrysh while I was brainstorming a good title for this song; in this example, embedded in the wall (photo used with blessing for cover). It reminds me of the MIDI notes placed in a DAW app.

Embedded Signal was created with:
- Reaper (DAW)
- Reaktor 6 (I live here)
- Kontakt 5
- Tea Towel Drums (Wavesfactory)
- Bite, Phasis, Dirt (fun!)
- Replika XT (oh I love this!)
- Boost (R.I.P. Cakewalk)
- Obelisk (inspired the scale)
