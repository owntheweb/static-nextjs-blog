Happy holidays from the Stevens family animatronic (and human family members of course)!

Featuring HotSpark the robot, this video was sent out as my annual holiday eCard suffered by friends, family, co-workers and LinkedIn folks. HotSpark was a custom robot I built with popsicle sticks, hot glue and hobby wire, with custom music created for this project as well. For the window display, I added three light connections to a relay, timed to the music along with mouth and servo movements.

The robot resided in our front window, raising close to $150 for [Springs Rescue Mission](https://www.springsrescuemission.org/). Neighbors scanned a QR code that lead to a [pledge.to donation page](https://www.pledge.to/colosprings), near-instantly triggering personalized thanks and song via a post-purchase webhook.
