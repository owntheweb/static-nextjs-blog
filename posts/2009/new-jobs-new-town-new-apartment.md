In a single trip on Saturday, the family caravan moved all of our boxes and furniture to a new apartment in Colorado Springs! I started my new job as web designer and developer at the Space Foundation on Monday while Amanda started her new job today. She is now a seasonal supervisor at a much larger Joann Fabrics and Crafts store.

The new apartment is located one block away from the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind, founded in 1874.

We're both taking a lot in and trying to catch up on sleep. So far everything is looking great! Now I just need to learn the names of 50 or so Space Foundation teammates I work with. Maybe I should bring the camera in and take snapshots to post on a bulletin board.

Expect more updates soon when time and energy allow.
