### Purpose

The Space Foundation Discovery Center is coming to a theater near you! (or at least the ad about the Discovery Center). The animation and music was produced to help increase local exposure for the Space Foundation's local attraction, the Space Foundation Discovery Center. It will be played on a trial basis before all movies at Cinemark Carefree Circle and IMAX Theater in Colorado Springs, Colorado, starting March 7, 2014.
