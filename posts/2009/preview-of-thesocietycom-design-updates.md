TheSociety.com will be publishing a large update early next week! The biggest updates include a revised navigation scheme lead by The Society Co-Founder Scott Berkley, two new products and content lead by Co-Founder Mike McFadden, and several visual updates and content additions developed/designed myself.

The biggest hit business-wise is The Global Bundle, with several "bundles" sold even before the official product launch (logo design by me yay!). The Global Bundle lets vacation rental managers and homeowners distribute their home to several websites while only managing it on one website. They save 75% off retail to have their property shown on websites like The Robb Report Collection, duPont Registry, Luxury Travel Magazine, Luxury RealEstate, TheSociety.com (naturally), HomeAway, the HomeAway network of websites, craigslist, and others.

Much effort was made to make the navigation simpler, and the information more complete. One page that I feel improved greatly is the sign in page. As there are increasing numbers of membership types, brief information about each membership was added, with increased push to learn more and sign up.

The About page was filled in to give details on our increased offerings, act as an overview of everything The Society covers, and drive more search engine traffic.

Several other pages such as the vacation rental criteria page were reformatted with updated styles, focus on imagery, and rewritten content. The site gets pushed to the staging area on Monday, and goes live shortly after testing. I'm looking forward to seeing it open up to the public.
