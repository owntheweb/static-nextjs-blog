![baily](/images/baily.jpg) Weekend before last, Amanda and I traveled to Cheyenne to spend time time with Amanda's brother before he went back to school, and to get to know the new family addition, Bailey. Bailey is a rescued beagle, about two years old. We met her while traveling back from Christian's wedding. She was VERY shy. This time was still very shy at first, but warmed up to Amanda immediately after she gave her a blanket (she lit up right away!). Bailey drew closer to me shortly after. Neat dog! She's beginning to fit in quickly. The trip was short, but quality spent.
