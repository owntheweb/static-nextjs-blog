The Broncos Fan Fair the 3rd and 4th was fantastickkkkkkly hot! While it was cloudy for a little while, most of the day was spent waiting in lines for signatures and baking my scalp off in the sun.

Amanda gets her visor signed after slowly nudging through a long line. $3.00 waters were conveniently purchased while in line.

Eric, Sandra, Amanda, and Eric, Sandra, Amanda... went wild in the stands. It felt good to finally explore the stadium as I have not been to an event there until now.

Amanda and I have our picture taken with a player. The event was slow, with much disorganization on the staff's end (like the 2 hours of screaming kids and parents when the kids couldn't get off the field after some sprinkler fun). I was however glad that Eric, Nathan, and Amanda were able to get some of the signatures they were looking for.
