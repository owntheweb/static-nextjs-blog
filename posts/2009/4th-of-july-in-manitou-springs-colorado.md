![fireworks1](/images/fireworks1.jpg) Happy 4th! ![fireworks2](/images/fireworks2.jpg) Amanda's parents and brother came to Colorado Springs for the holiday. Special thanks to Aunt Valley and Uncle Dan's foldout couch they gave us, and a bit more room in our new apartment, everyone was able to sleep in the house! We took a quick trip to Manitou Springs where it rained. We had a great time checking out the shops while running from shelter to shelter! There was a cool toy shop. It had tin robots! ![fireworks3](/images/fireworks3.jpg) The fireworks were great (Eric let me play with his camera). It was nice to get family together and spend time. Now it's time to plan a trip to see my parents and family in Wyoming. I actually miss swimming in the hot springs today.
