![black squirrel with brown squirrel in front yard](/images/blacksquirlb.jpg) Amanda took a photo of the squirrels eating bird seed in our front yard, one being a black/dark gray squirrel. This is the first time we've ever seen a black squirrel. This one is a lot more skiddish than the other squirrels, who don't mind walking a couple feet away while watching the bird feeders get filled. The other squirrels pick on this little guy. He stands his ground though. Maybe he's the one that put the hole is the brown squirrel's ear (can't quite see it in the photo). They were fighting on the porch as soon as we came in.
