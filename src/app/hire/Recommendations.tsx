            recommendation: `Chris was hired onto my team to manage a complex integration/customization with Twilio Flex to support our omni-channel contact center and CRM system. Previous attempts to make significant progress in this work-stream had proved very difficult, but Chris was undaunted by the challenge. He joined our team with an palpable exuberance and managed to slice through the ambiguity with an expert precision to bring a brittle implementation up to par, thoroughly document and prototype existing and future solutions, and independently manage his work-stream with thorough and timely communication. He dramatically reduced the delivery cycle times for our new feature releases in the Twilio space in a short span of time. Some highlights of his work include our first data integration into Twilio Flex to support timely customer information, an overhaul of our IVR flow to support intelligent routing and more stable releasees, and a plethora quality enhancements at his own recommendation to support shorter cycle times for our agents and customers. If you are looking for a passionate, communicative, diligent developer who thrives equally well in collaboration and independence, then Chris will be an excellent addition to your team.`,

            recommendation: `As the tech lead working responsible for the Twilio call center, I worked closely with Chris. His quick grasp of Twilio allowed him to enhance our Flex CRM and add needed resiliency to the overall system.

            Chris demonstrated proficiency across both front-end and back-end, integrating multiple Twilio services such as Flex, TaskRouter, and serverless functions with our internal APIs. He implemented several key improvements, including advanced customer-agent matching and enhanced context for incoming communications, which have noticeably improved key call center metrics.
            
            Twilio was not without issues -- Chris also served as an effective liaison between Twilio support and our developers, ensuring smooth communication and timely updates. His communication was always thorough and professional.

During his time at BombBomb, he do a great job leading his team in the midst of a lot of transition, and he demonstrated a keen attention to detail and care with some of our most complex systems. On one project, his team was tasked with maintaining and improving a particularly challenging area of our system, which they did with excellence. On another project, he led the successful migration of re-homing some mission-critical data from our database to S3 without downtime.

            Chris is curious, capable, and extremely sharp! He really was great to work with - he's kind, humble, and has a great sense of humor. I would love to work with him again in the future.

            recommendation: `One of the first things I worked with Chris on was a hackweek project where we had a shared idea. Chris was guiding me on a how we could implement the backend (which he already knew how to do.. but I didn't), while he was going to learn some new skills and play around with front end development. It was a great experience, and I quickly realized that Chris is a tinkerer, an experimenter, and person who wants to learn more, and a person who wants to make things better - and a great teacher, too. Chris leads quietly, through example, and shows how things are done - he does not just tell you how something should be done. His projects are fascinating, and his new blog digging deeper into AI show just how smart and curious he is. 

            Working as a Tech Lead for our main web app, Chris was instrumental in helping me lead my own team through successful projects. As an example, a major project was an Oracle to Postgres migration. Chris was able to prioritize any work handed to his team and have them execute on it quickly. This included a massive move of data out of the database into an AWS S3 bucket. His understanding of the risks, technical need, and know how to execute were all outstanding.
            
            It was a pleasure working with Chris. He taught me interesting things. He helped my team and the company execute on goals. He has a proven track record, and his light up glasses are cool. I haven't mentioned the glasses yet? Well, maybe you should reach out to Chris about those...`,

He has innate motivation to learn and investigate new technologies, grow and understand systems, and has the ability to execute and deliver on nearly anything you send his way. I was fortunate enough to be on the same team as him while working at BombBomb for ~1 year after he was hired, and Chris was able to transition fully into his role faster than almost anyone else I've ever worked with. He is a standout developer who never fails to bring his best. Between his side projects tinkering with electronics and integrations, and his friendly approach to problem solving, anyone could learn a thing or two by getting lucky enough to get to work with Chris.`,

His attention to detail in this important work lead to an iron-strong system that gained the respect of the entire company. I had the privilege of witnessing his determination and innovative thinking.

            Once I began working directly with Chris, I became privy to the kind, thoughtful, and inquisitive man he is. It was a pleasure to work with Chris, he brought fun to our daily stand-ups and jumped in headfirst when any of us needed a second pair of eyes.

            recommendation: `Working with Chris Stevens while he designed my website was a truly fantastic experience! As a photographer, I had a strong vision of how I wanted my images displayed, but that was about all I knew. There were many design and functionality elements I needed help deciding on. Chrisâ€™s experience with a diverse clientel was a huge advantage to me as his client and to the design of my website. It made it possible to design a site that is attractive to and user-friendly for the companies I want to reach. It is a huge confidence builder when I approach new clients. My website is, hands down, my number one tool of advertisement and marketing. I now, also have the ability to update the images on my site through an easy, straight-forward uploading system Chris created. This is truly priceless. Without this ability I would be spending tons of money to have someone else update my site. Chris set no limits on the design of my website. It could be as simple or complex as I wanted it to be. Chris never tried to overdesign the site, taking away from my images. The best part of working with Chris was his ability to really listen to what I wanted, add to my vision, and then put it all together in a really wonderful way. I would highly recommend Chris for your project, whether it be a completely new website or a redesign. Thanks again Chris, Shane Shane Macomber Photography www.shanemacomber.com`,
