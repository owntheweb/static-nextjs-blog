![Scottish Stained Glass](/images/20060619-scottishTreetrip.jpg) The new Scottish Stained Glass website has been published! While taking web advise and web training, my Creative Director, Tim Ovesen designed the layout. Graphics intern, Jiyea Yoo, framed and added content to the web gallery. I built the template and optimized the website for search engines based on content from the old website, and assigned new content to areas of the site. The website now owns the term "Scottish Stained Glass" in google searches. Yay! A before picture of the website is coming soon.
