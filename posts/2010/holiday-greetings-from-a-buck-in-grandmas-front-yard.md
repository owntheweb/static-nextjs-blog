A buck with holiday cheer passed by Grandma's window in Thermopolis, Wyoming. Amanda captured the video after Dad brought him to our attention.

Amanda and I had a fantastic week long visit with family in Wyoming. It was great to spend time with everyone, catch up, and avoid technology for a while.

Happy new year!
