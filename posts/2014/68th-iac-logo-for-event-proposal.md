### Roles

Designer

### Purpose

Brand an event to be pitched to the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

### Highlighted Features

With IAC proposed to take place in Florida, the logo features Florida's favorite citrus fruit also doubling as our planet, orbited by a stellar focus.

### Additional Information

While the Space Foundation's compelling pitch did not go through this year, it was the first step towards a quality event to take place in the U.S. or elsewhere in the near future.
