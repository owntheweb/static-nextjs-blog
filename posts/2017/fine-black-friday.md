Thanksgiving holiday is coming and that's delicious, and the day after that is America's finest retail "holiday", Black Friday. Celebrate the event that sends herds of crazed shoppers trampling into big box corrals for big screen TVs and the hottest toys that everyone must have... with this song. :D

Vocals performed by Becki Yukman.
