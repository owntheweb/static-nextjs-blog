![Amanda, Bob, and Sandra](/images/20060402-amandaFamily.jpg) Amanda, Bob, and Sandra, Amanda's parents Yay for cars! I admit that I am not very knowledgeable about car makes and models. That's no excuse though not to admire innovative machines with extreme power and design. Amanda's gang and I got together at the Denver International Auto Show. There was much of the latest and greatest to see from almost every car manufacturer out there. Many of the cars on display were not in mass production yet. Others were concept cars. ![combination lock](/images/20060402-comboLock.jpg) This was my favorite concept car. It looked like a mini armored money delivery truck. The interesting thing about this one is it appeared to have combination door locks. The back looked like a vault door. I hope no one is looking when the door is unlocked. ![It's fast, and eats gas](/images/20060402-fastRed.jpg) This one would be fun to ride in. It gets about 8 miles to the gallon in town, and 12 out of town. Someone who could afford this car could probably also afford the gas. ![Dodge Challenger](/images/20060402-dodgeChallenger.jpg) The Dodge Challenger was my favorite! This was Amanda's favorite as well. It's an update of the original. The back is different, and the car stands a bit taller among other things. ![Gladiator](/images/20060402-gladiator.jpg) The Gladiator resembles a jeep and truck mixed together. I love this one. Too bad it's not in production. ![camping roof](/images/20060402-campingRoof.jpg) Amanda and I will take this one on our next camping trip. It has a tent built into the roof! ![big luxury](/images/20060402-bigLux.jpg) I'd hate to be followed by this luxurious log. I bet it could take on a bus. ![great flames](/images/20060402-hotPaint.jpg) Check out the flames on this one. Very well done. Some other highlights included a hybrid truck that had about the same mileage as my truck, some hybrid cars that looked more like average cars, a truck that uses corn ethanol for fuel, and some great classic cars from the 30's, 40's, and 50's. The show was a great time. I can't wait to see what the manufacturers come up with next.
