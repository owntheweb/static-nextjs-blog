The Space Foundation acquired two very large water tanks for the Mission To Europa exhibit in the Space Foundation Discovery Center. After a request, volunteer time was allocated to control an underwater drone using a Nintendo-style controller (who would say no to that?!). Special thanks goes to Elias Molen who coordinated this project and built the hardware.
