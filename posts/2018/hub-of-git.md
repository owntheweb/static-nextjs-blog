What happens when you combine Salt-N-Pepa, Daft Punk and robots trying to rap? ... Something like this! Targeting developers who love to share their code and collaborate on projects via services such as GitHub, this song will surely be on DJ playlists in upcoming geek parties.

Vocals were extracted from a text-to-speech service, Amazon Polly. Original lyrics were split into individual word recordings via custom Node.js scripts. The lyrics were then worked in one word at a time, aligning/stretching syllables to the beat with added effects to help make the British accented voice sound more "natural".
